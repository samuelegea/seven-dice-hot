# Seven Dice

This is intended to be a really nice VTT for DnD 5e only (at least for now), where you can learn how to play and (at least hopefully, won't be lost in the game nevermore).

## Dungeons and Dragons

One of, if not **THE** most popular Tabletop RPG, is the baseline for most of the others and is heavly inspired by fantasy fiction and references like Lord of The Rings. Dispite that, today it already has it's own mithology and internal jokes/references, due to being around for so long and popular as well.

### The game

TLDR: Gather a small group of friends, choose one to DM you (more details ahed), make a character following some constraints of the rules and environment provided by your DM, and ROLEPLAY.

There are several instances where you can learn more about the game, how to play it better and so on, but the core principles of the game are:

- Character creation and roleplay
- Adventuring
- Exploration
- Combat (That's juicy)

#### Character Creation and roleplay

Have you ever watched a movie, when you were a kid, and tried to pretend that you were that character from that movie/comic/cartoon? Follow the same principle, with the difference that here you are in control of your character and the path they take.
